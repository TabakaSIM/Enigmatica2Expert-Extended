/*
 * 🚫 NoGUI — block every inventory GUI while wearing the technicolor glasses.
 *
 * REQUIREMENTS (read before changing):
 *   - While the glasses are worn, NO GUI may open, *except* those matching the
 *     `whitelist` below (pause menu, JEI, configs, the player's own inventory, …).
 *     This must be class-based, NOT block-based: many inventories are not blocks
 *     (backpacks and other item-opened GUIs, hotkey GUIs, entity GUIs, …), so we
 *     gate on the GUI on the client, where every screen / container passes through
 *     regardless of how it was triggered.
 *   - It must NOT desync / scramble the player inventory.
 *   - The player gets a status (action-bar) message when a GUI is blocked.
 *
 * WHY THIS DESIGN (and why the obvious ones fail):
 *   - Reacting to PlayerContainerEvent.Open on the server and force-closing is too
 *     late: the server has already streamed SPacketWindowItems to the client.
 *   - A server-initiated close (EntityPlayerMP.closeContainer / closeScreen) leaves
 *     the client closing via `closeScreenAndDropStack`, which desyncs the open
 *     container's windowId and scrambles the inventory.
 *   - The ONLY close path that never scrambles is the normal, client-initiated one
 *     (the Esc key): EntityPlayerSP.closeScreen() sends CPacketCloseWindow and the
 *     server reacts through its regular processCloseWindow path.
 *   - Suppressing the render (GuiOpenEvent setGui(null)) removes the flicker but
 *     reliably scrambles the inventory, so we do not do it. A no-flicker close via
 *     Forge RenderTickEvent was also tried and does NOT fire here (ZenUtils' generic
 *     event bridge + native Phase enum compare never matches).
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS (the "flicker, but never scramble" trade-off):
 *   Every client tick (PlayerTickEvent END) we look at the LIVE state and, if a
 *   blocked GUI is up, close it through the normal Esc path. "Blocked" =
 *     - a real server container is open (openContainer.windowId != 0 — this catches
 *       backpacks, machines, entity / item GUIs, not just blocks), AND
 *     - the current screen, if any, is not whitelisted, AND
 *     - the container class itself is not whitelisted (`containerWhitelist`, for GUIs that
 *       need a server container, e.g. the cosmetic armor inventory).
 *   The whitelisted client menus (pause, JEI, configs, own inventory) have windowId 0,
 *   so they are never touched.
 *
 *   We re-check LIVE state every tick instead of consuming a one-shot "pending close"
 *   flag. A flag is racy: clicking a block rapidly consumes/resets the flag before the
 *   re-opened container is ready, so that GUI slips through and stays open. Reading
 *   openContainer fresh every tick guarantees any blocked GUI — first open or rapid
 *   re-open — is closed the very next tick. The cost is a ~1 game-tick flicker, which
 *   is the price of never scrambling (the GUI must actually open and close normally so
 *   GuiContainer.onGuiClosed -> Container.onContainerClosed runs).
 *
 * Companion to the punch-to-extract feature (scripts/do/punch_inventory.zs): the
 * glasses make item-handling blocks "punch only" — left-click moves items, the GUI
 * never opens.
